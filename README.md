# imexplorer

Interact with your functional imaging data in your browser.

### Prerequisites

Currently, you will need to add my [analysis repository](https://github.com/tom-f-oconnell/al_imaging) to your PYTHONPATH environment variable so imexplorer can call some utility functions.

I will eventually package the analysis code.
